# AdvancedNotifierTTV-Server
A service that allows users to filter and write custom actions for stream notification. This is the server software that bundles and anonymizes interaction with Twitch's API. I'm open sourcing the server because I'll probably never have the resources to run this thing at scale.

## Planned features
 * Twitch integration so users can easily manage their TTV native notifications and advanced notifications in one place
 * WebUI with browser based notifications
 * Browser extension for notifications
 * Client service for custom actions
 * Desktop application for notifications and custom actions
 * Notifications for channels you don't follow
 * Filter notifications by
   * Game
   * Title
   * Tags
   * Day/Time range
 * Action engine
   * Launch executable/shell script
   * Send webhook
 * Application integration
   * Discord
   * Chatterino
   * OBS
 * Android/iOS app

## Road map
* v0.1.0 - Simple multiplexing of notifications
* v0.2.0 - Twitch auth
* ...
* v1.0 - Feature complete!
